# Carouscraper

My attempt at learning github actions and its associated CRON features.

I am using this to run a python webscraping script for a new monitor. Each new post will be sent to a telegram chat of mine with a quick link for new listings. The hope is to beat the game with speed and also unlock new potentials for similar CRONs.

Future updates might include having a setting set via a user-written pickle file to change queries in order to personalise the search and filter terms in the scraping script
